-- 15 Daily Practice Problems (DPP) on Subqueries
-- Basic Level 

-- 1. Retrieve the names of employees who earn more than the average salary of all employees.
SELECT name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employee);

-- 2. Find the employees who belong to the department with the highest average salary.
SELECT * FROM Employee 
WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id 
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY department_id 
    ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC 
    LIMIT 1
);

-- 3. List all employees who have made at least one sale.
SELECT * FROM Employee 
WHERE emp_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT emp_id FROM Sales);

-- 4. Find the employee with the highest sale amount.
SELECT * FROM Employee 
WHERE emp_id = (
    SELECT emp_id 
    FROM Sales 
    ORDER BY sale_amount DESC 
    LIMIT 1
);

-- 5. Retrieve the names of employees whose salaries are higher than Shubham's salary.
SELECT name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary > (SELECT salary FROM Employee WHERE name = 'Shubham');

-- Inermediaate Level:

-- 1. Find employees who work in the same department as Abhishek.
SELECT * FROM Employee 
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM Employee WHERE name = 'Abhishek')
AND name != 'Abhishek';

-- 2. List departments that have at least one employee earning more than 60,000.
SELECT * FROM Department
WHERE department_id IN (SELECT DISTINCT department_id FROM Employee WHERE salary > 60000);

-- 3. Find the department name of the employee who made the highest sale.
SELECT department_name 
FROM Department 
WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id 
    FROM Employee 
    WHERE emp_id = (
        SELECT emp_id FROM Sales ORDER BY sale_amount DESC LIMIT 1));

-- 4. Retrieve employees who have made sales greater than the average sale amount.
SELECT e.name, s.sale_amount
FROM Employee e
JOIN Sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
WHERE s.sale_amount > (SELECT AVG(sale_amount) FROM Sales);

-- 5. Find the total sales made by employees who earn more than the average salary.
SELECT SUM(sale_amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM Sales 
WHERE emp_id IN (
    SELECT emp_id 
    FROM Employee 
    WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employee));

-- Advanced Level :

-- 1. Find employees who have not made any sales.
SELECT * FROM Employee
WHERE emp_id NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT emp_id FROM Sales);

-- 2. List departments where the average salary is above ₹55,000.
SELECT d.department_name, AVG(e.salary) as avg_salary
FROM Department d
JOIN Employee e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_id, d.department_name
HAVING AVG(e.salary) > 55000;

-- 3. Retrieve department names where the total sales exceed ₹10,000.
SELECT d.department_name 
FROM Department d
JOIN Employee e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
JOIN Sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
GROUP BY d.department_name
HAVING SUM(s.sale_amount) > 10000;

-- 4. Find the employee who has made the second-highest sale.
SELECT e.name, s.sale_amount
FROM Employee e
JOIN Sales s ON e.emp_id = s.emp_id
WHERE s.sale_amount = (
    SELECT MAX(sale_amount) 
    FROM Sales 
    WHERE sale_amount < (SELECT MAX(sale_amount) FROM Sales));

-- 5. Retrieve the names of employees whose salary is greater than the highest sale amount recorded.
SELECT name 
FROM Employee 
WHERE salary > (SELECT MAX(sale_amount) FROM Sales);
